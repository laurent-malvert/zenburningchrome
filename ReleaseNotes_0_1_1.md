## Notes ##

This version of the ZenBurningChrome Theme is minimalist and does not aim at theming the whole browser. Special pages are not themed yet (extensions, download, console...), but they might be in the future if the extension system permits.

For the moment the ZenBurningChrome Theme is a stand-alone application. In the future, a ZenBurningChrome Extension will complete it to allow for more dynamic styling of normal web pages browsed by the end-user, and to allow for shortcuts customization (vi- and emacs-style).
However, if the extension system permits it in the future, all of these might get packaged in a single extension, for ease of use (at the moment, the extension system does not allow a "theme" extension to embed "scripted" extension code.
