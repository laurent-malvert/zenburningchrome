# History #

## Genesis ##

The ZenBurningChrome project was started after wasting^W spending some time reconfiguring my emacs installation to use the Zenburn vi theme to address some readability issues on my office's computer to address some readability with my general setup and especially my screen. After customizing dark themes for my operating system and several applications, I also reconfigured my emacs installation to use the port of the Zenburn vi theme and thought of using it as the base for most of my other UI-tweaking tasks.

Then came the need to customize Google Chrome for the same reasons, and to find a way to customize web-pages to render in a less aggressive fashion on my screen.

## Acknowledgments ##

The name ZenBurningChrome is derived from both the names of the Zenburn theme and the Google Chrome and Chromium web-browsers. The contraction ZenburnChrome reminded be of the novel "Burning Chrome" by acclaimed sci-fi author William Gibson from the cyberpunk fame.
Caps are added for emphasis on these elements.
