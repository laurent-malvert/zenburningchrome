The ZBC Theme is a low-contrast visual theme for Google Chrome & Chromium.

It is based on the [Emacs 24 theme by bbastov][1], itself based on an
earlier [Emacs port of the theme by Daniel Brockman][2]. All of which
are based on an original idea of a [Vi theme by Jani Nurminen][3].



The [ZBC projects][4] are a collection of themes and extensions, named
after the ZBC Theme (the original project) and the Chrome/Chromium
browsers, and paying tribute to the "Burning Chrome" novel by William
Gibson.


*Special Thanks to:* the original creators of the Zenburn themes,
Google, the Google Chrome Team, the Chromium project and William
Gibson.
